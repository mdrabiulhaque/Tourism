                            You can go flashback to that incident any time. In 1952, due to the more number of Bangla
                            speakers, people protested to make ‘Bangla’ the state language over Urdu. In response,
                            Pakistani police openly fired at the protesters to disassemble their movement. Agonizingly,
                            few students among Dhaka University and Dhaka Medical College died.

                            Bangladesh sculptor Hamidur Rahman along with Novera Ahmed designed and built the modern
                            Shaheed Minar.

                            Eventually, 21st February, the day of the barbaric incident, is declared as International

                        <p>Star Mosque:
                            This mosque is based in Armanitola, Dhaka. A very antique mosque built by Mirza Golam Pir at
                            19th century.

                            Built in Mughal style, initially, it was a simple rectangular mosque. The roof was crowned
                            by 3 domes and covered with star shaped china clay tiles. These tiles are also seen in the
                            exterior.

                            Later, on the 20th century, a local businessman named Ali Jahan Bepari renovated the mosque.
                            Started by adding a veranda, he repaired the tiles with mosaic. It was popular decoration by
                            that time. Along with the domes, the exterior and the interior are done with star shaped
                            tiles. That is why the mosque is called Star mosque. In 1987, the Ministry of Religious
                            Affairs of Bangladesh added a new prayer hall which eventually led to 2 additional domes in
                            the mosque.</p>
